Learning in the Hello World of computer programming.

My name is Marcellus Brady and I'm a beginning computer programmer. Me background is in computer network security and I do have some experience with networking and network security. I would like to learn more programming geared to pen testing and web development as well as game development due to the fact that I have interests in all these areas and they are inter-related. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Network Security and a master's degree in Information Systems Management Computer Network Security. Although I have these degrees, I was lacking the necessary programming skills to stay relevant and that is why I decided to learning programming skills like HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, Python, Linux, and Javascript frameworks like JQuery, Angular, and Node.js so that I could be useful not only to employers, but also as a freelance business owner if I so choose.
