Learning in the Hello World of computer programming.

My name is Marcellus Brady and I'm a Full Stack Developer and Network Security Analyst. My background is in computer network security and have 3 years experience with Web Development and Blockchain. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Network Security and a master's degree in Information Systems Management Computer Network Security. Although I have these degrees, I was lacking the necessary programming skills to stay relevant and that is why I decided to learn more programming skills like HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, Python, Linux, and Javascript frameworks like JQuery, React, and Node.js so that I could be useful not only to employers, but also as a freelance business owner if I so choose. Recently, I've added certifications in CompTia Security + and AWS Solutions Architect professional with more to come for Blockchain.
